\section{Additional Explanations}

Global arrays are distributed array objects supported in a message-passing program through the GA library calls. They can be created, destroyed, and manipulated using a set of GA operations.

\subsection{Attributes of GA Operations}

Global arrays can have the following attributes.

\begin{itemize}
\item One-sided/independent - references shared or remote data without remote process cooperation (unlike send/receive pair)
\item Collective - requires all processes to make the call
\item Local - operation is local to each process and does not require communication
\item Atomic - operation has mutual exclusion built in 
\item Non-blocking - Nonblocking operations initiate a communication call and then return control to the application. A return from a nonblocking operation call indicates a mere initiation of the data transfer process and the operation can be completed locally by making a call to the wait (e.g., nga_nbwait) routine.
\end{itemize}
 
\subsection{Language Interoperability}

GA provides C and Fortran interfaces  to the same array objects in the same (mixed-language) program.

\subsection{Higher-dimensional Array API}

All releases of GA less than 3.0 supported only 2-dimensional arrays. Starting with the release of 3.0, GA arrays can be be essentially of arbitrary dimensions but the package as compiled supports up to 7 dimensions (Fortran limit for multidimensional arrays).

The 2-D API for backward compatibility with older versions of the toolkit remained unchanged. For some GA operations, two versions of the API are available. They are identified with a ``GA" or ``NGA" prefix that correspond to either the old 2-dimensional or the new arbitrary(N)-dimensional version, respectively.
